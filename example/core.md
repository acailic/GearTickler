### **3. Example Use Case**

#### **Deploying a BERT Model for Sentiment Analysis**

1. **Define the Workload**:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: geartickler.com/v1alpha1
   kind: AIWorkload
   metadata:
     name: bert-sentiment
   spec:
     modelName: bert-base-uncased
     modelVersion: v1.0.0
     framework: ONNX
     replicas: 2
     resources:
       limits:
         cpu: "2"
         memory: "4Gi"
         nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
     inferenceEndpoint: /api/v1/predict
     autoscaling:
       enabled: true
       minReplicas: 2
       maxReplicas: 5
       targetCPUUtilization: 75
       targetGPUUtilization: 80
   ```

2. **Deploy**:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f bert-sentiment.yaml
   ```

3. **Monitor**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get aiworkloads
   kubectl describe aiworkload bert-sentiment
   ```

4. **Scale**:
   - The operator automatically scales the workload based on CPU/GPU utilization.

---

### **4. Competitive Advantage**

- **Tailored for AI/ML Workloads**:

  - Unlike generic Kubernetes operators, it understands the unique requirements of AI/ML workloads (e.g., GPU scheduling, model versioning).

- **Framework Integration**:

  - Seamlessly integrates with popular ML frameworks and tools.

- **Cost Efficiency**:

  - Optimizes resource usage to reduce cloud costs.

- **Developer Productivity**:
  - Simplifies the deployment and management of AI models, allowing data scientists to focus on model development.

---

### **5. Future Enhancements**

- **Multi-Model Support**:

  - Deploy multiple models in a single workload for shared resource optimization.

- **Advanced Autoscaling**:

  - Support for custom metrics (e.g., inference latency).

- **Security**:
  - Integration with Kubernetes RBAC and secure model storage.

---

This operator is particularly valuable for organizations running AI/ML workloads at scale, as it addresses the unique challenges of deploying and managing these workloads on Kubernetes.
